# Netflix Data Analysis using dbt & Snowflake

##  Project Overview
This project is an **exploratory data analytics pipeline** built to understand and practice the **core concepts of dbt (data build tool)** and **Snowflake** using a Netflix-style dataset.

The goal of this project was **learning and exploration**, not building a production-grade analytics system. It focuses on how modern analytics engineering workflows are structured using dbt and a cloud data warehouse.

---

## What I Explored
- Setting up **dbt with Snowflake**
- Understanding dbt project structure and configurations
- Creating:
  - Staging models
  - Intermediate transformation models
  - Core analytical models
- Writing SQL-based transformations using dbt
- Using dbt for:
  - Model dependency management
  - Modular and reusable SQL transformations
- Connecting Snowflake to **Power BI**
- Creating basic dashboards and visualizations in Power BI

---

## Out of Scope (Not Covered)
To keep the project focused on fundamentals, the following advanced or production-level topics were intentionally **not implemented**:

- Custom schema generation
- dbt hooks
- Operational tasks and built-in operators
- Naming convention enforcement
- Query optimizations
- Performance tuning
- Workflow integration
- Airflow orchestration and scheduling
  
---

## Visualization Layer
After completing the transformations in dbt and Snowflake:
- Power BI was connected directly to Snowflake
- Exploratory dashboards were built to visualize Netflix content trends and key metrics

---

## Tech Stack
- **dbt**
- **Snowflake**
- **SQL**
- **Power BI**
- **GitHub**

---

## Purpose
This project serves as:
- A hands-on learning exercise in analytics engineering
- A reference for understanding dbt fundamentals
- A foundation for future projects involving orchestration, optimization, and production workflows
